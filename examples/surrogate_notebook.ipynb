        "\n",
        "In the code above, `batch_size` is set to 64. This means that during training, the model will see 64 samples of data before updating its internal parameters (weights and biases). This process of seeing a batch of data and then updating is called one **iteration**.\n",
        "\n",
        "Instead of training on the entire dataset at once (which can be computationally expensive and memory-intensive), the data is divided into smaller batches. The model iterates through these batches, making adjustments to its parameters after seeing each batch.\n",
        "\n",
        "##### *Why Use Batches?*\n",
        "\n",
        "**1. Computational Efficiency:** Processing the entire dataset in one go can be very slow, especially for large datasets. Batches make the process more manageable by breaking it down into smaller steps. This is crucial for training deep learning models which often require vast amounts of data.\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. Memory Management:** Loading the entire dataset into memory might not be feasible, especially when dealing with very large datasets or limited hardware resources. Batching allows the model to work with a smaller subset of the data at any given time, reducing memory requirements.\n",
        "\n",
        "**3. Generalization:** Training on batches can improve the model's ability to generalize to unseen data. This is because the model is exposed to a variety of data points in each batch, preventing it from overfitting to specific examples in the training set. Updates based on a single data point at a time (e.g., with a batch size of 1 which is called stochastic gradient descent) could update the weights in a way that is not good for the model's prediction performance over all of the data. Using batches provides a better average for what data the model tends to see and thus better update performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "**4. Noise Reduction:** The gradients (directions for updating model parameters) calculated on a batch are less noisy compared to those calculated on individual samples. This leads to more stable and smoother training, potentially helping the model converge faster to a good solution.\n",
        "\n",
        "##### *Choosing the Right Batch Size*\n",
        "\n",
        "The choice of batch size is a hyperparameter that can significantly impact the training process. There's no one-size-fits-all answer, and the optimal batch size often depends on factors like:\n",
        "\n",
        "**1. Dataset Size:** Larger datasets can handle larger batch sizes, while smaller datasets might require smaller batches to avoid overfitting.\n",
        "**2. Model Architecture:** Complex models with many parameters might benefit from larger batch sizes for better gradient estimations.\n",
        "**3. Hardware:** Available memory and processing power influence the maximum batch size you can use.\n",
        "**4. Training Time:** Larger batches can lead to faster training epochs (one pass through the entire dataset), but they might require more epochs to converge. Smaller batches require more iterations per epoch and are usually slower but are helpful in preventing issues like overfitting.\n",
        "\n",
        "##### *In Practice:*\n",
        "\n",
        "- Common Batch Sizes: 32, 64, 128, 256 are frequently used batch sizes.\n",
        "- Experimentation: It's often necessary to experiment with different batch sizes to find the best one for a particular problem. You can evaluate performance on a validation set to guide your choice."

        "- **Output Size:** The number of output values the network produces. Here, it's 2, corresponding to the predicted S and I values.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Layers:** Neural networks consist of interconnected layers of neurons. Hidden layers process the input data and extract features, while the output layer produces the final predictions. Deeper networks (more hidden layers) can learn more complex relationships, but they are also more computationally intensive to train. This code uses hidden layers.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Dropout:** A regularization technique that helps prevent overfitting. During training, dropout randomly ignores a fraction of the neurons in a layer, forcing the network to learn more robust features that are not dependent on any single neuron. dropout_prob (set to 0.1 here) controls the probability of a neuron being dropped out."

        "    - Sets up the optimizer (`torch.optim.Adam`) to update model parameters.\n",
        "    - Creates a learning rate scheduler (`ReduceLROnPlateau`) to adjust the learning rate by a factor (here, 0.5) when the validation stops improving for a certain number of epochs (here, `patience=5`).\n",

        "2. **Training Loop:**\n",

        "        - The model is set to training mode (`model.train()`).\n",

        "          - *Forward Pass:* The model makes predictions (outputs) based on the input data (inputs).\n",
        "          - *Calculate Loss:* The loss function (criterion) is used to calculate the error between the predictions (outputs) and the actual target values (targets)\n",
        "          - *Backward Pass and Optimise:* `optimizer.zero_grad()` resets the gradients of the model's parameters. `loss.backward()` calculates the gradients of the loss with respect to the model's parameters. `optimizer.step()` updates the model's parameters based on the calculated gradients and the learning rate.\n",

        "> **1. Do the patterns of model performance across the beta-gamma parameter space make intuitive sense given your understanding of SIR dynamics?** For example, are there regions where all models perform well or poorly? If so, how do those regions relate to the basic reproductive number (R0), which is influenced by beta and gamma? Can you explain why certain parameter combinations might be more challenging for the models to predict accurately?\n",
        "\n",
        "> **2. What specific features or boundaries can you identify in the heatmaps, and how might they be linked to the underlying SIR model or the training data used for the neural networks?** Do you notice any sharp transitions in performance, or regions where one model significantly outperforms others? How might these features relate to the training region boundary, the line representing R0 = 1, or the contour lines for different R0 values? Is the training region shown with the blue box correct? Is this the entire region that it was trained on, and if not not does this explain the heatmap patterns?\n",

        "> **3. Considering the overall performance visualized in the heatmaps, which model appears to be the most robust and reliable surrogate for the SIR model across a wide range of parameter values?** What specific evidence from the heatmaps supports your conclusion? Are there scenarios or parameter ranges where a particular model might be preferred over others, and why? How might you use these insights to make informed decisions about model selection for future epidemiological studies or simulations?"

        "\n",
        "1. **Data Generation:** We used the `emidm` package to simulate SIR model dynamics with varying parameters using Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) to systematically explore the parameter space and generate training, validation, and test datasets.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Data Preparation:** We created a custom PyTorch `Dataset` class (`SIRTimeSeriesDataset`) to efficiently handle the time series data and implemented `DataLoader` for batch processing during training.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Model Building and Training:** We defined and trained three different neural network architectures:\n",
        "   - **Feedforward Neural Network (FFNN):** A basic neural network with multiple layers.\n",
        "   - **Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU):** A recurrent neural network designed for sequential data.\n",
        "   - **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM):** Another recurrent neural network with more complex gating mechanisms.\n",
        "   We trained these models using the Adam optimizer and a learning rate scheduler, monitoring their performance on validation data to prevent overfitting.\n",
        "   - We also applied a sigmoid activation function to the final layer of each model to ensure the predictions were bound between 0 and 1 and included normalization.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Model Validation:** We assessed the trained models' performance by predicting on a held-out test dataset and comparing the predictions to the ground truth SIR model simulations.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Visualization:** We visualized the training history, showing the training and validation losses over epochs, and highlighted the best-performing epochs for each model."
